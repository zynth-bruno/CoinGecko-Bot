# CoinGecko Bot

I don't know if this is worth to be called a bot since it's only 30 lines. 
I basically got tired of refreshing the page for coupons to become available so i made a bot to tell me when they become available.

# To Repurpose this code

1. Fork the Repo
2. Change the URL for the page you want to curl
3. Change the header, so that it's not the same machine making the curls
4. Change what you want to find in the entire HTML by changing the .find() function
5. Change what text you want to see printed
